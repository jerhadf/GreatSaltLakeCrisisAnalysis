## Introduction
The Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah is shrinking at an alarming rate. The largest saltwater
lake in the Western Hemisphere has nearly halved in size, and in 2022 it reached its lowest level
on record (Meng 2019). GSL’s volume has decreased by 67%, with about 75% of the loss driven
by water use and 25% due to a millennial drought amplified by global climate change
(Wurtsbaugh 2022). This is not the first time a major saline lake has dried up due to human
influence: in the 1960s, water diversion from the Aral Sea led to a 90% decrease in its water
volume. As a result, the climate became harsher, yields from fishing and agriculture collapsed,
and millions of people suffered from dust, pollution, and water scarcity. This disaster could have
been avoided. Utah’s beloved and iconic lake is now careening toward a similar crisis—but it is
not too late to avert. Without rapid action to avert this desiccation (drying) crisis, the Great Salt
Lake as we know it could disappear, and an invaluable ecosystem will be gone.
